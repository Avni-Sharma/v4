- Sentiment Analysis/Opinion mining on micro blogging sites like Twitter using NLTK in Python, for automatic collection of corpus to train classifiers which can then determine the positive and negative sentiments for a given query.
- Supervised machine learning was used and a live sentiment chart was obtained to graph the sentiments in real time. Tweets were graphed into positive and negative. For this project I chose the topic Demonetization in India.
